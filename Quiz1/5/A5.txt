We'll prefer to use 16 bit mode (real mode). Even in real mode, we can easily access upto 1MB RAM, by left shifting the address and adding the offset to get a 20 bit address.
By this method, we can easily access 320KB of RAM. 

The advantage of long mode is that it has support for faster device drivers, virtual memory, paging, etc.

Here, we are planning to use it on a embedded system. Assuming it won't requrie these functionalities, we will prefer to use real mode for running our programs.

However, this has limitation, because we won't be able to run 32 bit, or 64 bit programs on our system.
